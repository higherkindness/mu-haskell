# Mu for Haskell

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/higherkindness/mu-haskell/workflows/Haskell%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/higherkindness/mu-haskell/actions)

This repo defines a set of libraries to write microservices in a format- and protocol-independent way. It shares the same goals as [Mu for Scala](http://higherkindness.io/mu/), but using idiomatic Haskell and more type-level techniques.

## [Documentation](docs)

This set of libraries are thought to be built using [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org). Just jump into the folder and run `stack build`! The top-level `stack.yaml` defines a common resolver and set of dependencies for all the packages.
