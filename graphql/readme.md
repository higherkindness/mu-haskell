# mu-graphql

This package contains everything you need to build a **type-safe GraphQL server** in Haskell with Mu. Check out the code at [`exe/Main.hs`](https://github.com/higherkindness/mu-haskell/blob/master/graphql/exe/Main.hs) for a complete example.

## GraphQL client examples

If you are interested in seeing how this server can be consumed in some GraphQL client frameworks, you have these other examples available:
