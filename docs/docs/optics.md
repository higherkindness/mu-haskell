# Mu-Optics

We created a new package `mu-optics` in the **release v0.3 of Mu-Haskell** to give an easier API to build servers and clients using lenses and prisms (probably the ultimate API ðŸ˜‰). This document aims to be a reference of how to use this new library and the common use cases for it.

## Accessing fields with `#field`

When you want to refer to a method of your type-level schema, whereas in the server or the client, you can use the getter lens (`^.`) in conjunction with the `OverloadedLabels` extension to access that field, as in the example:

```haskell
watching :: GRpcConnection PersistentService 'MsgProtoBuf -> IO ()
watching client = do
  replies <- client ^. #allPeople -- <- example usage
  runConduit $ replies .| C.mapM_ print
```

## Generate records with `record` and `record1`

Sometimes you need to create values that match the generated type-level schema representations, for example, to construct the request of a certain service. Usually, those types will be records, and to help you achieve that task we provided the helpers `record` and `record1`:

```haskell
get :: GRpcConnection PersistentService 'MsgProtoBuf -> String -> IO ()
get client idPerson = do
  let request = read idPerson
  putStrLn $ "GET: is there some person with id: " ++ idPerson ++ "?"
  response <- client ^. #getPerson $ record1 request -- <- using `record1` to create a request
  putStrLn $ "GET: response was: " ++ show response
```

Why the difference? Well, due to some ambiguity in the context of our Schemas, we need to help GHC to know if the record we're creating contains only one field (`record1`) or more (`record`) contained in a tuple of elements.

> This design might be improved in the future, by using "[OneTuple](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/OneTuple-0.2.2.1/docs/Data-Tuple-OneTuple.html) to rule them all"

```haskell
add :: GRpcConnection PersistentService 'MsgProtoBuf -> String -> String -> IO ()
add client nm ag = do
  let person = record (Nothing, T.pack nm, read ag) -- <- using `record` to create Person, a more complex type
  putStrLn $ "ADD: creating new person " ++ nm ++ " with age " ++ ag
  response <- client ^. #newPerson person
  putStrLn $ "ADD: was creating successful? " ++ show response
```

## Accesing enums with prisms!

bla bla bla Ã±a Ã±a Ã±a

## Generating enums with `enum`

Sometimes, you'll have your types defined as something like enums, as in this protobuf example:

```protobuf
enum Weather {
  SUNNY = 0;
  CLOUDY = 1;
  RAINY = 2;
}
```

As expected, we also provided you with the tools you need to construct a valid enum-like value with the helper `enum`:

```haskell
import Mu.Schema
import Mu.Schema.Optics

type Weather = Term WeatherProtocol (WeatherProtocol :/: "Weather")

sunnyDays :: Int -> [Weather]
sunnyDays n = replicate n (enum @"SUNNY") -- <- see the magic here! âœ¨
```

Simply enable `TypeApplications` and provide the value you are looking for to construct the enum! ðŸš€
